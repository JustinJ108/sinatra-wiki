wiki.rb
welcome.erb

get "/new" do
    erb :new
end






So wondering how when form gets submitted it ends up being written to a file. 
It must get routed through the wiki.rb page



In route for post requests - under the post create method
he just sends some text to the page.


- next I need to list all my pages
